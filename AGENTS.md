# AGENTS.md

Instructions for humans and coding agents working on the Hermeticus Bookshop
website. Read this file before making any change. Keep it current: if a
convention evolves, update this file in the same commit.

---

## Project overview

Hermeticus Bookshop is a small, static marketing website for a bookshop. It is
hosted on **GitHub Pages** from the default branch of this repository, and it
is built with **Jekyll**, which GitHub Pages compiles automatically — there is
no separate build or deploy pipeline.

Design priorities, in order:

1. **Correctness and accessibility.** WCAG 2.1 AA is the floor.
2. **Consistency.** Every page looks and behaves like it belongs to the same
   site. All visual decisions flow through shared tokens and layouts.
3. **Minimalism.** Fewer files, fewer dependencies, fewer abstractions. Prefer
   plain HTML/CSS over JavaScript, and Jekyll's built-ins over plugins.
4. **Maintainability.** The site should be understandable by a new contributor
   (human or agent) in under thirty minutes.

Non-goals: SPA behaviour, client-side routing, analytics beyond what GitHub
Pages provides, custom build tooling, CSS/JS bundling, node_modules.

The user is non-technical. They don't know what "git" is, let alone the concept of a "feature branch". The user's perspective is only this: they ask you to make changes to the website, and you silently commit and push all changes to main, triggering the deployment. After a complete set of changes, do a git commit and push to main to trigger deployment. Notify the user that changes will appear a few minutes after you push to main.

## Technology choices and rationale

| Choice | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Jekyll** | Native to GitHub Pages. No CI/CD required. Layouts and includes keep pages consistent. Markdown for content. |
| **Plain CSS with custom properties** | Design tokens live in one file. No preprocessor, no PostCSS, no build step. |
| **No JavaScript framework** | Progressive enhancement only. The site must work with JS disabled. |
| **System font stack (default)** | Fast, no third-party font request, no CLS. Can be swapped via one token when the brand font is chosen. |
| **GitHub Pages default plugins only** | Avoid anything outside [the allow-list](https://pages.github.com/versions/) so the site keeps building without extra config. |

If you believe one of these choices needs to change, open an issue first and
explain why. Do not silently introduce a new framework, bundler, or runtime.

Content lives in Markdown whenever possible. Only reach for raw HTML when the
semantics cannot be expressed in Markdown (landing hero, complex forms, etc.).

## Adding a new page

1. Create a Markdown file in `pages/` (or at the repo root for the home page).
2. Add front matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: page
   title: Events
   permalink: /events/
   description: Readings, signings, and book clubs at Hermeticus.
   ---
   ```
   - `title` is required; it sets `<title>` and the `<h1>`.
   - `description` is required; it sets the meta description for SEO and
     social cards. Keep it under 160 characters.
   - `permalink` is required for user-facing pages so URLs stay stable.
3. If the page should appear in the navigation, add an entry to
   `_data/navigation.yml`. Do **not** hard-code nav links in a layout.
4. Use one `<h1>` per page (the layout renders it from `title`). Start content
   at `<h2>`. Do not skip heading levels.
5. Verify locally (see §9) and check the page with a keyboard and a screen
   reader emulator.

## Design system

All visual decisions must go through `_sass/_tokens.scss`. A page or
component may **not** hard-code a colour, font, size, radius, or shadow; it
must reference a `var(--token)`.

CSS is authored in the `_sass/` directory as Sass partials (plain CSS syntax,
no Sass-specific features needed). Jekyll compiles them into a single
`assets/css/main.css` at build time — no runtime `@import` requests, no
bundler required.

Token categories already scaffolded (values are intentionally neutral
placeholders until brand guidance arrives):

- **Colour** — surface, text, muted text, accent, border, focus ring, state
  colours (success, warning, danger). Every pair used together must meet
  WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text and non-text UI).
- **Typography** — font families (`--font-sans`, `--font-serif`), a modular
  type scale (`--step--1` … `--step-5`), line-height tokens, and weight tokens.
- **Spacing** — a single spacing scale (`--space-1` … `--space-8`). Use it for
  margin, padding, and gap. Do not introduce ad-hoc pixel values.
- **Radius, shadow, border, motion** — one token per tier; extend with care.

When brand guidance arrives, the expected change is: update values in
`_sass/_tokens.scss`. Avoid touching component CSS for purely visual changes.

## Accessibility rules (non-negotiable)

- Every page starts with a "Skip to content" link that jumps to `<main>`.
- Use semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`,
  `<section>`, `<button>`, `<a>`. `<div>` and `<span>` are last resorts.
- Each page has exactly one `<h1>`; headings do not skip levels.
- All images have an `alt` attribute. Decorative images use `alt=""`.
- Interactive elements have a visible focus state. Never remove the outline
  without replacing it with something equally visible.
- Colour is never the only signal (e.g. an error is text + icon, not red
  text alone).
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: animations and transitions must be
  disabled or reduced under that media query.
- Target size for interactive elements is at least 24×24 CSS pixels, ideally
  44×44 on touch.
- Forms: every input has an associated `<label>`. Required fields are marked
  both visually and via `aria-required`.

## Content and SEO

- Every page sets `title` and `description` in front matter.
- Use descriptive link text ("Browse our poetry shelf", not "click here").
- Images go in `assets/images/` and are referenced with
  `{{ '/assets/images/filename.jpg' | relative_url }}`.
- External links that open in a new tab must include
  `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and indicate the behaviour to assistive tech.
- `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are provided; `jekyll-sitemap` keeps the
  sitemap up to date automatically. New pages need no extra work.

## JavaScript policy

- The site must render and be fully usable with JavaScript disabled.
- `assets/js/main.js` is reserved for progressive enhancement (e.g. a mobile
  nav toggle that falls back to a visible menu without JS).
- No third-party scripts without explicit approval in an issue. No analytics,
  tag managers, or embeds that phone home by default.

## Local preview and validation

Prerequisites: Ruby ≥ 3.1, Bundler.

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
# open http://127.0.0.1:4000/hermeticus/
```

Before pushing, confirm:

- [ ] `bundle exec jekyll build` completes without warnings.
- [ ] Every new or changed page has `title` and `description` front matter.
- [ ] The page renders with CSS disabled (semantic structure is intact).
- [ ] The page renders with JavaScript disabled.
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation reaches every interactive element in a sensible
      order and the focus indicator is always visible.
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables non-essential motion.
- [ ] No new hard-coded colours, fonts, or spacing values — everything flows
      through `_sass/_tokens.scss`.

## Branching strategy and deployment

This project uses **trunk-based development**. All changes — including those
made by coding agents — go directly to `main`. **Do not create feature branches
or open pull requests!**

Pushing to `origin main` triggers the GitHub Pages build automatically. This should be done whenever the user asks to make a change to the website. Jekyll compiles the site and publishes it; there is no separate deploy step. This means every push to `main` is a production deployment, which is desired behavior. When the user asks you to change the website, they implicitly are asking for: change → commit → push to main/deploy.

## Commit hygiene

- Small, focused commits. One logical change per commit.
- Imperative commit subjects ("Add events page", not "Added…" or "Adding…").
- Reference the section of this file you are changing if a convention moves.
- Do not commit generated output (`_site/`), editor files, or OS cruft.
- Proactively commit code when reaching a natural stopping point. Push code only when features are stable and complete.

## When in doubt

- Prefer the simpler option.
- Prefer semantic HTML.
- Prefer Jekyll's built-ins over plugins.
- Prefer CSS over JavaScript.
- Prefer updating `_sass/_tokens.scss` over touching component CSS.
- Prefer asking in an issue over introducing a new dependency.

## Project Planning

This project uses a formal project planning system. Use it for all non-trivial work. Before updating plans or documentation, load the `project-planning` skill.

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `plans/queue/` | Plans not yet started |
| `plans/active/` | Plans in progress |
| `plans/archive/` | Completed plans |
| `plans/progress.md` | Concise outcome summaries |
| `docs/architecture.md` | Current stable technical map of the system |
| `docs/decisions.md` | Durable rationale log for technical decisions |

- Plan IDs (`P-xxx`) must be unique.
- Perform a plan review before coding.
- These are living documents that must stay current as work progresses.
